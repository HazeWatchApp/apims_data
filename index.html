        <h1>Haze Watch Malaysia Open Data Project</h1>
        <p>
            The Malaysia air pollution index data is presented in a static JSON file. 
            Simple, effective and uses very low resources. 
            Look ma! No databases!
        </p>

        </ul>
        
        <h2>How do I use this data?</h2>
        <p>You can clone this repository and issue a <code>git pull</code> command to get the latest data.</p>
        
        <h2>What can I build using this data?</h2>
        <p>You can build a web application, an Android app, an iOS app. Whatever that rocks your socks.</p>
        
        <h2>Is this free?</h2>
        <p>Yes. 
        This data is under Creative Commons Public License. 
        Which means, it's public data and you can use it for free.</p>
        
        <h2>What else do I need to know?</h2>
        <p>Since this data source is hosted on Github, we encourage you to clone this repository to your own server 
        and have your application pull this data from your own server. We think Github has a limit on bandwidth usage.
        If they decide to close us down, then access to this data will not be available.
        That will defeat the purpose of making this data open and accessible for the general public.</p>
