Yes.

### What else do I need to know?

Since this data source is hosted on Github, we encourage you to clone this repository to your own server and have your application pull this data from your own server. 
We think Github may have a limit on bandwidth usage. 
If they decide to shut us down, then access to this data will not be available. 
That will defeat the purpose of making this data open and accessible for the general public.

Help us help you.
